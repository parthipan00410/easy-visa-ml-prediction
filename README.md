# Easy Visa – Advanced Machine Learning Project

This project applies advanced machine learning techniques to predict visa approval outcomes based on applicant data. It is designed to simulate real-world classification challenges in a government or immigration context.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Problem: Predict visa approval status based on features such as job category, employer, salary, location, etc.
- Goal: Use advanced ML models to maximize predictive accuracy.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Encoding & Scaling
- Model Building: Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall,F1 Confusion Matrix
